                Navigator is a Laboratory Information Management System ( LIMS ) designed as a web based interface for MRG Lab's analysis process. Navigator provides MRG customers with real-time updates on their samples, the ability for lab technicians to track samples as they flow through the testing process, and preventative maintenance suggestions based on data collected from machinery in similar conditions.

                    The MRG Labs team are experts in the development of grease sampling tools and analysis, reliability training classes, and the development of predictive maintenance programs for industrial equipment. These 
                    programs and technologies have enabled their partners to more accurately locate, predict and prevent mechanical problems, saving both time and money for their companies.

                    Before Navigator, MRG used WebView to manage their lab. Technicians could enter sample data, generate reports and perform a wide variety of calculations however, Webview was not intuitive and there was no way to track where samples were in the analysis process. 
                    
                    <br><br>Due to these inefficiencies, samples would often get "lost" in the process and require lab technicians to spend excess time looking for them in the database. Webview also lacked the ability to manage customer accounts and send automated emails meaning employees would have to manually email customers their analysis reports.
                
                    <br><br>Webview also costs $2000 per month ( $24,000 per year )

                    <div class="sample-status-text">
                        Samples are categorized into 5 states and it was difficult to keep track of which samples were in any specific state with Webview. When customers ask for an update on their samples, it would take technicians anywhere between 10-20 minutes to find all their samples.

                        While WebView is sufficient for storing and analyzing data, it lacks features necessary for the business side of a laboratory such as automated email reminders 
                        and product promotions. When MRG approached me, they were looking for a way to automatically remind customers to resample their machinery every 6-9 months. Before Navigator,
                        an employee would have to maintain an Excel sheet with sample dates and manually write emails to re-engage customers. They were also looking for a way to use big data analytics to help
                        sell other products and analysis services by visualizing how a customer's equipment compares to other equipment in similar conditions.

                    machine and the previous set up required a corresponding laptop to view the results. Then, a lab technician had to manually input the data into WebView. 
                    Each machine is capable to sending results via email or JSON post but that was not configured for WebView.

                        An unexpected breakdown can cost a company millions in repair costs and lost revenue. Preventative maintenance is performed to avoid equipment failure and 
                        consists of replacing grease, oil and parts known to fail frequently.<br><br>

                        Navigator aids in the preventative maintenance process by alerting customers if their machinery requires service based on sample results. Results are compared to other samples from machinery in similar conditions to detect machine-specific problems. Navigator also sends automated email reminders every several months to ensure customers regularly inspect their machinery.
