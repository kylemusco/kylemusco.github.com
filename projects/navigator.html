                Navigator is a Laboratory Information Management System ( LIMS ) designed as a web based interface for MRG Lab's analysis process. Navigator provides MRG customers with real-time updates on their samples, the ability for lab technicians to track samples as they flow through the testing process, and preventative maintenance suggestions based on data collected from machinery in similar conditions.

                    programs and technologies have enabled their partners to more accurately locate, predict and prevent mechanical problems, saving both time and money for their companies.

                    Before Navigator, MRG used WebView to manage their lab. Technicians could enter sample data, generate reports and perform a wide variety of calculations however, Webview was not intuitive and there was no way to track where samples were in the analysis process. 
                    
                    <br><br>Due to these inefficiencies, samples would often get "lost" in the process and require lab technicians to spend excess time looking for them in the database. Webview also lacked the ability to manage customer accounts and send automated emails meaning employees would have to manually email customers their analysis reports.
                
                    <br><br>Webview also costs $2000 per month ( $24,000 per year )

                        Samples are categorized into 5 states and it was difficult to keep track of which samples were in any specific state with Webview. When customers ask for an update on their samples, it would take technicians anywhere between 10-20 minutes to find all their samples.

                        While WebView is sufficient for storing and analyzing data, it lacks features necessary for the business side of a laboratory such as automated email reminders 
                        and product promotions. When MRG approached me, they were looking for a way to automatically remind customers to resample their machinery every 6-9 months. Before Navigator,
                        an employee would have to maintain an Excel sheet with sample dates and manually write emails to re-engage customers. They were also looking for a way to use big data analytics to help
                        sell other products and analysis services by visualizing how a customer's equipment compares to other equipment in similar conditions.

                Navigator categorizes samples into 5 interchangeable tables. Users can search for specific samples or filter by time. Navigator allows lab technicians to edit multiple rows simultaneously

                <br><br>
                Customers have their own version of this interface that displays their samples. Now, instead of having to call MRG and ask for updates, they can login to Navigator and see where their samples are in real-time.
                This provides customers with a level of transparency that wasn't available through WebView and saves lab technicians from having to stop analyzing samples to deal with customer calls.

                        An unexpected breakdown can cost a company millions in repair costs and lost revenue. Preventative maintenance is performed to avoid equipment failure and 
                        consists of replacing grease, oil and parts known to fail frequently.<br><br>

                        Navigator aids in the preventative maintenance process by alerting customers if their machinery requires service based on sample results. Results are compared to other samples from machinery in similar conditions to detect machine-specific problems. Navigator also sends automated email reminders every several months to ensure customers regularly inspect their machinery.
